This module gave me a solid foundation in understanding how generative models compress and reconstruct data, and how latent vectors serve as the heart of many AI applications like image synthesis, anomaly detection, and more.

ðŸ“˜ Key Learnings from the Module:

Fundamentals of Autoencoders & VAEs

How latent space captures meaningful data features

Techniques for visualizing and interpreting latent vectors

Differences between deterministic and probabilistic encoding

Real-world applications of latent space in GenAI

ðŸ§  What I Explored:

How AEs and VAEs learn to compress and reconstruct data

The structure and significance of latent vectors

Visualizing latent spaces and how they help in generation
